PHP Full REST API with Authorization is an example project demonstrating a complete RESTful API built in native PHP with header-based authorization. It includes both a server API and a client that consumes the API. The server serves secured REST endpoints, and the client makes authorized requests to those endpoints and parses JSON responses.
